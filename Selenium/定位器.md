# 元素选择策略

### 在 WebDriver 中有 8 种不同的内置元素定位策略：

## Creating Locators
To work on a web element using Selenium, we need to first locate it on the web page. Selenium provides us above mentioned ways, using which we can locate element on the page. To understand and create locator we will use the following HTML snippet.
```
<html>
<body>
<style>
.information {
  background-color: white;
  color: black;
  padding: 10px;
}
</style>
<h2>Contact Selenium</h2>

<form action="/action_page.php">
  <input type="radio" name="gender" value="m" />Male &nbsp;
  <input type="radio" name="gender" value="f" />Female <br>
  <br>
  <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
  <input class="information" type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="Jane"><br><br>
  <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
  <input class="information" type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Doe"><br><br>
  <label for="newsletter">Newsletter:</label>
  <input type="checkbox" name="newsletter" value="1" /><br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>

</body>
</html>
```

## 1.class name
The HTML page web element can have attribute class. We can see an example in the above shown HTML snippet. We can identify these elements using the class name locator available in Selenium.
```
driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, "information") 
```

## 2.CSS seletor  
CSS is the language used to style HTML pages. We can use css selector locator strategy to identify the element on the page. If the element has an id, we create the locator as css = #id. Otherwise the format we follow is css =[attribute=value] . Let us see an example from above HTML snippet. We will create locator for First Name textbox, using css.
```
  driver = webdriver.Chrome()
  driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "#fname")  
```

## 3.id
We can use the ID attribute available with element in a web page to locate it. Generally the ID property should be unique for a element on the web page. We will identify the Last Name field using it.
```
  driver = webdriver.Chrome()
  driver.find_element(By.ID, "lname")
```

## 4.name
We can use the NAME attribute available with element in a web page to locate it. Generally the NAME property should be unique for a element on the web page. We will identify the Newsletter checkbox using it.
```
  driver = webdriver.Chrome()
  driver.find_element(By.NAME, "newsletter")  
```

## 5.link text
If the element we want to locate is a link, we can use the link text locator to identify it on the web page. The link text is the text displayed of the link. In the HTML snippet shared, we have a link available, lets see how will we locate it.
```
  driver = webdriver.Chrome()
  driver.find_element(By.LINK_TEXT, "Selenium Official Page")
```

## 6.partial link text
If the element we want to locate is a link, we can use the partial link text locator to identify it on the web page. The link text is the text displayed of the link. We can pass partial text as value. In the HTML snippet shared, we have a link available, lets see how will we locate it.
```
  driver = webdriver.Chrome()
  driver.find_element(By.PARTIAL_LINK_TEXT, "Official Page")
```

## 7.tag name
We can use the HTML TAG itself as a locator to identify the web element on the page. From the above HTML snippet shared, lets identify the link, using its html tag “a”.
```
  driver = webdriver.Chrome()
  driver.find_element(By.TAG_NAME, "a") 
```

## 8.xpath
A HTML document can be considered as a XML document, and then we can use xpath which will be the path traversed to reach the element of interest to locate the element. The XPath could be absolute xpath, which is created from the root of the document. Example - /html/form/input[1]. This will return the male radio button. Or the xpath could be relative. Example- //input[@name=‘fname’]. This will return the first name text box. Let us create locator for female radio button using xpath.
```
  driver = webdriver.Chrome()
  driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "//input[@value='f']")  
```

# Relative locator methods

## 1.Above
If the email text field element is not easily identifiable for some reason, but the password text field element is, we can locate the text field element using the fact that it is an “input” element “above” the password element.
```
  email_locator = locate_with(By.TAG_NAME, "input").above({By.ID: "password"})
```

## 2.Below
If the password text field element is not easily identifiable for some reason, but the email text field element is, we can locate the text field element using the fact that it is an “input” element “below” the email element.
```
  password_locator = locate_with(By.TAG_NAME, "input").below({By.ID: "email"})
```

## 3.Left of
If the cancel button is not easily identifiable for some reason, but the submit button element is, we can locate the cancel button element using the fact that it is a “button” element to the “left of” the submit element.
```
  cancel_locator = locate_with(By.TAG_NAME, "button").to_left_of({By.ID: "submit"})
```

## 4.Right of
If the submit button is not easily identifiable for some reason, but the cancel button element is, we can locate the submit button element using the fact that it is a “button” element “to the right of” the cancel element.
```
  submit_locator = locate_with(By.TAG_NAME, "button").to_right_of({By.ID: "cancel"})
```

## 5.Near
If the relative positioning is not obvious, or it varies based on window size, you can use the near method to identify an element that is at most 50px away from the provided locator. One great use case for this is to work with a form element that doesn’t have an easily constructed locator, but its associated input label element does.
```
  email_locator = locate_with(By.TAG_NAME, "input").near({By.ID: "lbl-email"})
```

## 6.Chaining relative locators
You can also chain locators if needed. Sometimes the element is most easily identified as being both above/below one element and right/left of another.
```
  submit_locator = locate_with(By.TAG_NAME, "button").below({By.ID: "email"}).to_right_of({By.ID: "cancel"})
```
